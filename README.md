Unit Test , Mocking and Spying with Prisma , Posgres , Node 
Clone this repository 
I am using the node 18th version , more specifically v 18.17.1
npm install
npm run test 
I have also written .yml file in github workflows for CI/CD , so that if you make a pull request to master branch then all the tests will run.
Thank You, have a great day. You can also contact me on linkedin and my details are present at www.umardev.com
